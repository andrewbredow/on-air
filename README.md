# on-air

Experimental project for a hardware light that indicates when a webcam or microphone is in-use. The goal here is to allow those of us confined to our home offices to indicate to our loved ones when casual drop-ins are not ideal ;)

## Hardware

https://www.amazon.com/Recording-Studio-Light-Display-i480-r/dp/B00QBKPUNA/ref=br_lf_m_g3pa9sn25h8f8qy_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&s=hi is the basic idea.

## Software

This is the key thing to research, since the hardware is basically a switch ;) If we are able to build a more generic library, this might provide some interesting options like setting a Slack status based on calls too.
